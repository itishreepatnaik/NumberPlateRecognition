# NumberPlateRecognition
Simple Optical Character Recognizer (OCR) model to identify the text from an image

Data set downloaded from Kaggle.

Approach:-

Step1:- Importing a sample image of a car with a license plate and define some functions.

Step2:- Finding characters in the resulting images and resizing it to a dimension such that all characters seem distinct and clear.

Step3:- Matching contours to license plate or character template

Step4:- Creating a Machine Learning model and training it for the characters.

Step5:- Creating Model.

Step6:- Training the CNN model.

Prerequisites:-

OpenCV: OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision plus its open-source, fun to work with and my personal favorite. I have used version 4.1.0 for this project.

Python: I have used version 3.9.2 here.

IDE: Jupyter notebook.

Keras: Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

Scikit-Learn: Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
